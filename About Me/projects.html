    <div class=aboutpg3 above>

      <p> This was a graded assignment in which I had
        to redesign the app icon of a app that I enjoyed using.
        The app that I had redesigned was an open-world game called
        Sky: Children of Light. <br>
        This game was very much focused on light and darkness and thus
        the themes for both of these artworks were very luminous.
        I have 2 of them.<br> Read on to find out why.

      <p> An app splash page for my redesigned app icon.
        I wanted it to be simple and minimal, whie still being able
        to express some of the beautiful graphics that sky has to offer.
        Thus I had ended up putting the logos that I had redesigned for my app icon on the app splash page.
        It was actually at that point of time that I had drawn the candle design and my mentor told me that I could
        submit both, provided that I could create an app icon for that as well.

      <p>This was the biggest graded assignment we had to do.
        It was an infographic which main purpose was to show the features,
        some statistics and how to play the game. Its main purpose was to attract people to download and play the game

      <p> This started off as a project on krita,
        in which I later transfered as a psd file to autodesk sketchbook in which I could draw with my 7th gen ipad and
        apple pencil after i finally upgraded.
        This took me 2 months to finish it as I had kept on procrastinating.

      <p>
        The story behind this artwork was that I was browsing through instagram and saw many realistic artworks and
        thought, why don't I try drawing something like that even if I might fail horribly.
        Armed with my then kind of failing ipad 2 which i was surprised could even support autodesk sketchbook and a
        blunt stylus which was a free gift from a convention ages ago,
        I started drawing. It ended up quite satistfactory i guess. But nowhere near what i would consider beautiful.

        This was actually the first artwork I did that sparked my interest in digital art.
        It was drawn on my tiny iphone XR on autodesk sketchbook on a particularly cold and rainy afternoon
        with that free stylus pen mentioned in the last artwork. It was nearly chrismas,
        i was enjoying the cold weather very much and I wished it snowed in Singapore. So might as well draw a sunset
        and snow together.

        This was the second artwork I had done
        digitally as a result of my newly attained interest in digital art.
        This was also drawn on my ipad 2 with the blunt stylus. I got inspired as I had always liked fantasy.
        Drawing this made me feel as if I was in another world and could escape from reality.
