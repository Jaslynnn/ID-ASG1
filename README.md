# Your Project's Name
My Personal Website

Are you sick and tired of boring websites that are not creative or innovative, and have information that is so cluttered together you have to squint your eyes to read anything? Fret no more, introducing to you my website, an all in one website that is innovative, creative and interactive. My website features a minimalistic style that is easy on the eyes of viewers and is at the same time interactive enough to provide users a fun and enjoyable experience by its smooth and fluid animations. 

My website contains information on myself , my portfolio and my resume, in which you can actually download with just a click of a button. But first, lets start off with the description of my about me page. This page starts off by introducing you to a palette of autumn, with colours that range from dark coral to rasberry, chocolate , all of them accented with brown tones. The first thing that will catch your eye would be this huge card in the center of the page. Hover over it to zoom in into its contents, and even of my face. Next, look tp the top left and you will see a navigation bar at the top left of the webpage. This unscrollable bar makes it easy for navigation throughout the 3 pages. The contact button is anchored to the bottom of the page, in which the contact me form is located. A html scroll variable is also applied to ensure that the page scrolls fluidly down. Next, look to your right and you will find that there is a scroll bar, that makes navigating the page so much easier and faster. Every button and element in this page is animated, so feel free to have fun hovering over everything on this page. 

On my resume page, the format of the page is similar to my about-me page as I wanted the designs to be consistent. A syou hover over it, the card descripting my resume will zoom in, as well as the words.

Now on to my portfolio page,each of my projects are showcased in beautiful cards, which are connected to an about slider that slides outwards as you hover over it. Not only that, but the words on the slider also enlarge at the same time, with the same fluidity that the slider does. This beautiful movement is definitely an eye-catcher and what makes my website stand out from other. However, this is not all there is. Hover over the screen to see an enlarged image of all of my works in my portfolio.

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## Design Process

This website is for myself and for employers who are looking to recruit UI/UX designers as I want to work as a ui,ux designer in the future.This project would be the best way to land myself a job as I would be able to impress employer with my portfolio.

As a student, I want to create an website that is has a trendy and modernised style, so that I will be able to impress my employers as they would know that they would be be able to get a impressive website.
As a student, I also would like to showcase my works while keeping it simplistic yest easy to access. For example, the small images of my projects will be enlarged as you hover your mouse over them.

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 

These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

feature 1- A contents bar that does not scroll with the page. There are 4 buttons displayed on the invisible contents bar to make the design look sleek. Each button leads to the page stated on it. This also makes it easy for the user to navigate throughout the website and they are more likely to spend more time in my website.

feature 2- A scroll bar. There is a scrollbar that makes it easier for the user to scroll through the page with just a drag so that the user will not feel tired scrolling with their mouse.

feature 3- There is a card that floats in the middle of the page. This adds onto the sleekness to the design as it looks detached to the rest of the page.

feature 4- Enlargment of almost whatever is hovered over. This adds to the user-experience as it feels as it the user is touching the screen and able to make an impact on the website. This provides user enjoyment. Easing in and easing out is also includes so as to make the process look smooth and simultanious.

feature 5- Enlargement of text as the user hovers over it so that the user will be able to read better.

feature 6- Minimalistic design with no extravagant fonts and an easy to read font. Each component also has a space around it to provide a good sense of spacing so that none of the information seems cluttered.

feature 7- Centered design that provides a good focal point in which users can easily focus on certain areas.

feature 8- Consistent color palette throughout all the pages.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1. about me page:
   1.Go to the "resume" page
   2.Press the "about me" button on the top left of the page
   3.Observe if the button directs me to the "about me" page

2. resume page:
   1. Go to the "about me" page
   2. Press the "Resume" button on the top left of the page
   3. Observe if the button directs me to the "Resume" page

3. projects page:
   1. Go to the "about me" page
   2. Press the "Projects" button on the top left of the page
   3. Observe if the button directs me to the "Projects" page

4. Contact anchors
   1. Go to the "about me" page
   2. Press the "Contact" button on the top left of the page
   3. Observe if the button scrolls down the page automatically to the contacts box.
5. Hover buttons
   1. Hover over each button
   2. observe if the button changes colour according to the color assigned to it.
6. Transition elements
   1. Hover over each card element 
   2. observe if the enlargement of each element is smooth

/*1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.*/

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
My project works well on bigger browsers as they tend too look the most put together. The original layout is still kept on quite a few tablets as I had used flexboxes for many of my components and elements, thus the layout and centering of the elements remain the same. On mobile however, I had removed some elements so as to  make the design of the webpage look cleaner, and arranged some of the elements that were important below each other so as to make the webpage look cleaner

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
